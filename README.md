Ever since the departure of all professionals to Ireland, mathematicians have been painting. They set up ladders and they were about to start with a brush when they suddenly became fascinated by the geometric layout that was created between the buildings.

One of the ladders has length 𝑥, second drab and are based on opposite buildings. When we look from the side, they intersect at the height 𝑐 above street level. Mathematicians soon realized that on the basis of these values ​​they can calculate the width of the street 𝑤. Their fascination reached its zenith when a colleague passing by next informed them that you could write a program that would do it. 

Entrance The first line of the standard input contains the natural number 𝑍 - the number of data sets. The description of one set is as follows:  One line containing 3 positive real numbers 𝑥, 𝑦 and 𝑐 not greater than 1000. You can assume that they correspond to a realizable geometric situation.  
Exit For each data set, write a line containing the street width, given with an accuracy of 3 decimal places. 
Example For input data:   
4   
30 40 10   
12.619429 8.163332 3   
10 10 3   
10 10 1  
The correct answer is:   
26033   
7,000   
8,000   
9.798
